      Basketball is a fast-paced and exciting team sport played between two
      teams of five players each. The main objective is to score points by
      shooting the ball through the opponent’s hoop. The game was invented by
      Dr. James Naismith in 1891 and is now popular worldwide. Basketball
      improves physical fitness by building strength, speed, coordination, and
      endurance. It also teaches important values like teamwork, discipline, and
      leadership. Professional leagues such as the NBA have made basketball a
      global sensation, inspiring young players to stay active and develop their
      skills both on and off the court.
