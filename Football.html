      Football, also known as soccer, is the most popular sport in the world,
      played in almost every country. It is played between two teams of eleven
      players, with the main goal of scoring by kicking the ball into the
      opponent’s net. A standard match lasts 90 minutes and requires speed,
      stamina, teamwork, and strategy. Major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup
      and UEFA Champions League attract millions of fans globally. Football
      promotes physical fitness, discipline, and cooperation among players. It
      also brings people together across cultures, making it more than just a
      game—it is a global passion.
