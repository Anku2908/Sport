      Sports play an important role in building physical fitness, mental
      strength, and social skills. Regular participation in sports improves
      heart health, muscle strength, flexibility, and overall stamina. It also
      teaches discipline, teamwork, leadership, and time management. Playing
      sports reduces stress, boosts confidence, and helps students stay focused
      in their studies. Popular sports like cricket, football, badminton, and
      athletics encourage healthy competition and friendship among players. In
      today’s digital age, sports remind people to stay active and balanced.
      Therefore, including sports in daily life is essential for a healthy body,
      positive mindset, and successful future for personal growth and lifelong
      wellness.
