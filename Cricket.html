      Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in
      countries like India, England, Australia, and Pakistan. It is played
      between two teams of eleven players each. The main aim is to score more
      runs than the opposing team. Cricket is played in different formats such
      as Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20). The
      game requires skills like batting, bowling, fielding, and teamwork.
      Cricket teaches discipline, patience, and strategic thinking. It also
      brings people together and creates a strong sense of sportsmanship and
      national pride.
