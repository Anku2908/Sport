      Tennis is a popular sport played between two players (singles) or two
      teams of two players (doubles). The main aim is to hit the ball over the
      net into the opponent’s court so that they cannot return it. Tennis
      improves physical fitness by increasing strength, agility, balance, and
      endurance. It also develops mental skills such as focus, strategy, and
      quick decision-making. Major tournaments like Wimbledon, the US Open, the
      French Open, and the Australian Open make tennis famous worldwide. Tennis
      is enjoyed by people of all ages and promotes a healthy, active lifestyle.
